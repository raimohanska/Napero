Some helpers for fun Haskell programming with kids.

| example            | explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| say "lol"          | says "lol" aloud (uses the command line say) |
| p "lol"            | prints "lol" as text |
| i                  | reads a line of input from the user |
| w 1                | waits one second |
| s [w 1, say "lol"] | run commands sequentially |
| rnd 4              | generates random number between 1 and 4 |

Have a look at the [Guess](https://github.com/raimohanska/Napero/blob/master/Guess.hs) example program. You can run it with `runhaskell Guess.hs`.
